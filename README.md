## 🤖🧠 Multi-Agent AI System using LangChain 🚀
Welcome to an advanced Multi-Agent AI system powered by LangChain! ⚙️ This project demonstrates multiple AI agents collaborating to solve complex tasks, combining their unique abilities to produce intelligent outcomes. Perfect for real-life use cases like research, customer support, and automation.

## 💡 What is this?
A fully functional multi-agent architecture, where multiple AI agents:

🔹 Communicate with each other.
🔹 Share knowledge dynamically.
🔹 Collaborate to solve problems efficiently.

## ⚙️ How It Works
Multiple specialized AI agents are created (e.g., Researcher 🤓, Coder 💻, Summarizer 📝).
Agents interact and pass information intelligently using LangChain.
Agents combine knowledge to generate final responses.
User receives a refined, multi-perspective AI answer.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
Python 🐍
LangChain 🦜🔗 for multi-agent interaction.
LLMs (OpenAI, Llama2, Claude, etc.) as agent brains.
HTML, CSS, JavaScript 🎨 (Frontend UI).
PostgreSQL 🐘 (if persistent storage needed).

## ✨ Key Features
🤝 Multi-agent collaboration using LangChain.
💬 Context-aware conversations between agents.
⚡ Fast and intelligent problem-solving.
🖥️ User-friendly web interface for interaction.
